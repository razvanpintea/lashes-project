# Lash Extensions Booking Platform

This project is a web application for a premium lash extensions salon. Clients can easily schedule appointments and view available services. The project is divided into two parts:

- **Frontend**: Built with React, it offers an easy-to-use interface for clients. The React code can be found in the "react" directory.

- **Backend**: Developed with ASP.NET, the backend powers the booking system. The .NET API code is located in the "api" directory.

The goal of this platform is to streamline the appointment booking process and provide clients with real-time availability for their convenience.
